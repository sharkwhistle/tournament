This project is the second part of the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree program. It is a python module which keeps track of players in a tournament. It test various functionality of the module, including Table/View creation, insertion and deletion, and also tests a  Swiss-style tournament arrangement, which produces a definite winner in a few rounds, no-one is eliminated and everyone wins at least one round.

To run the tournament module, first open up a Terminal shell (Mac OSX).

From the Command Line, clone the Udacity tournament Git repo using the following command:

git clone http://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm fullstack

After you have cloned the tournament repo, you will need to install Virtual Machine and Vagrant if you do not already have them installed on your computer.

After installation, run the following commands:

vagrant up

vagrant ssh

This will take a few minutes to start up, but once you are logged into the Virtual Machine, cd into the follwing path:

cd /vagrant/tournament

You will then need to start PostgreSQL by typing psql into the command line.

Once loged into PostgreSQL, type the following command:

\i tournament.py

This will successfullt run the tournament.py file against the Udacity tests!
